            <h1>Study Tips</h1>

            <h2>1. The Pomodoro Technique</h2>
            <p>Study in focused intervals (25 minutes) followed by short breaks (5 minutes).
                After 4 sessions, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).</p>

            <h2>2. Active Recall</h2>
            <p>Test yourself on the material rather than passively re-reading notes.
                Use flashcards or write questions and answers on paper.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Spaced Repetition</h2>
            <p>Review information at increasing intervals over time to reinforce memory.
                Combine with flashcards for optimal results.</p>

            <h2>4. Prioritize Your Tasks</h2>
            <p>Use the Eisenhower Matrix to sort tasks into:<br/>
                Urgent & Important<br/>
                Important but Not Urgent<br/>
                Urgent but Not Important<br/>
                Neither Urgent nor Important<br/>
                <br/>
                Focus on the most impactful tasks first.</p>

            <h2>5. Break Down Large Topics</h2>
            <p>Divide subjects into smaller, manageable chunks.
                Focus on one chunk at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</p>

            <h2>6. Teach Someone Else</h2>
            <p>Explaining concepts to others forces you to understand them thoroughly.
                Pretend you're teaching a class or a friend.</p>

            <h2>7. Create a Study Schedule</h2>
            <p>Dedicate specific blocks of time to each subject.
                Alternate between difficult and easy topics to stay motivated.</p>

            <h2>8. Minimize Distractions</h2>
            <p>Study in a quiet place or use noise-canceling headphones.
                Turn off notifications on your phone or use apps like Forest to stay focused.</p>

            <h2>9. Use Visual Aids</h2>
            <p>Summarize information into diagrams, flowcharts, or mind maps.
                Use color-coding for better retention.</p>
            
            <h2>10. Stay Healthy</h2>
            <p>Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night to boost memory and focus.<br/>
                Stay hydrated and eat brain-healthy foods like nuts, fruits, and vegetables.<br/>
                Take short exercise breaks to re-energize.</p>

            <h2>11. Study with Friends (if it helps!)</h2>
            <p>Form a study group to discuss and quiz each other.
                Ensure the group stays focused on the subject.</p>

            <h2>12. Practice Past Exams</h2>
            <p>Solve previous years' papers to familiarize yourself with the format and types of questions.
                Simulate an exam environment to practice time management.</p>

            <h2>13. Use Mnemonics</h2>
            <p>Create acronyms, rhymes, or stories to remember complex information.<br/>
                Example: PEMDAS for the order of operations: 
                Parentheses, 
                Exponents, 
                Multiplication, 
                Division, 
                Addition, 
                Subtraction.</p>

            <h2>14. Take Care of Your Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Incorporate relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation.
                Set realistic goals and don't overwork yourself.</p>
            
            <h2>15. Reward Yourself</h2>
            <p>Treat yourself after completing study sessions to stay motivated.<br/>
            Example: "After finishing this chapter, I'll watch one episode of my favorite show."</p>
